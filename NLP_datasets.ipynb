In \\\"Suicide Bid,\\\" a girl partakes in a claustrophobic hazing ritual for a sorority that soon unleashes the supernatural. Next, in \\\"Ozzy's Dungeon,\\\" a sleazy TV show host is forced to endure a brutal obstacle gauntlet inspired by his own show, which caused the permanent disfigurement of a former contestant. In \\\"The Gawkers,\\\" voyeuristic teenagers unearth the horrifying truth behind the girl next door. Finally, in \\\"To Hell And Back,\\\" two filmmakers asked to document a summoning ritual on the eve of YK are accidentally transported to a hellish dimension, where a tormented soul guides them in escaping its demonic inhabitants.

Then, in \\\"Suicide Bid\\\", a cruel sorority hazing ritual that takes teasing too far harbours a ghastly secret. Next, in \\\"Ozzy's Dungeon\\\", the unfeeling, selfcentred host of a twisted game show gets a taste of his own medicine. And in \\\"The Gawkers\\\", a team of suburban teenage perverts mess with the wrong persontheir cute new neighbour. Finally, in \\\"To Hell and Back\\\", two unsuspecting filmmakers find themselves neckdeep in trouble when, instead of recording a demonsummoning ritual on New Year's Eve, they discover dark portals work both ways. \\\"The Gawkers\\\" Frame OneA stopmotion war video scene plays where the WWII soldiers are preparing for combat.

In this remake of 1988's \\\"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,\\\" 2 con-women hustle in a small French Riviera town one for small amounts from average men, and one for higher amounts wealthier men. They bet on what looks like an easy target. Winner gets $500K from him, and the loser leaves town forever. Josephine is a rich con woman that only takes on the richest men, while Penny is a low-class con woman who hustles men for money in nearby bars. Both take on a tech millionaire, and whoever fails to con money from him before the other loses. The film starts in a bar where a guy named Jeremy (Timothy Simons) is waiting for his date, a model-like blonde woman. Instead, he is met by con artist Penny Rust (Rebel Wilson). She pretends that the girl in the picture that Jeremy was waiting for is her sister who was too shy to meet him because she is ashamed of her small breasts, so Penny almost tricks Jeremy into giving her money for her \\\"sister's\\\" boob job. However, another guy that Penny swindled finds her in the bar with the cops, and she runs out of there, managing to hide among trash bags since her dress looks like one. Somewhere in France, a Danish man named Mathias (Casper Christensen) spots an American woman, Josephine Chesterfield (Anne Hathaway), sitting alone at a bar. He approaches her and hears her story about winning a lot of chips at the casino. Mathias offers to sell Josephine his mother's valuable bracelet, only for an Interpol officer, Brigitte Desjardins (Ingrid Oliver), to come by and say that Josephine is an international criminal and that she stole the chips from an old man. In reality, Brigitte and the old man, Albert (Nicholas Woodeson), are in cahoots with Josephine, who is really an English woman posing as a dim-witted American to try and con other men. She manages to swipe Mathias's bracelet and swap it with a fake.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"genre\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"horror\",\n          \"action\",\n          \"romance\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In \\\"Suicide Bid,\\\" a girl partakes in a claustrophobic hazing ritual for a sorority that soon unleashes the supernatural. Next, in \\\"Ozzy's Dungeon,\\\" a sleazy TV show host is forced to endure a brutal obstacle gauntlet inspired by his own show, which caused the permanent disfigurement of a former contestant. In \\\"The Gawkers,\\\" voyeuristic teenagers unearth the horrifying truth behind the girl next door. Finally, in \\\"To Hell And Back,\\\" two filmmakers asked to document a summoning ritual on the eve of YK are accidentally transported to a hellish dimension, where a tormented soul guides them in escaping its demonic inhabitants.

Then, in \\\"Suicide Bid\\\", a cruel sorority hazing ritual that takes teasing too far harbours a ghastly secret. Next, in \\\"Ozzy's Dungeon\\\", the unfeeling, selfcentred host of a twisted game show gets a taste of his own medicine. And in \\\"The Gawkers\\\", a team of suburban teenage perverts mess with the wrong persontheir cute new neighbour.

In this remake of 1988's \\\"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,\\\" 2 con-women hustle in a small French Riviera town one for small amounts from average men, and one for higher amounts wealthier men. They bet on what looks like an easy target. Winner gets $500K from him, and the loser leaves town forever. Josephine is a rich con woman that only takes on the richest men, while Penny is a low-class con woman who hustles men for money in nearby bars. Both take on a tech millionaire, and whoever fails to con money from him before the other loses. The film starts in a bar where a guy named Jeremy (Timothy Simons) is waiting for his date, a model-like blonde woman. Instead, he is met by con artist Penny Rust (Rebel Wilson). She pretends that the girl in the picture that Jeremy was waiting for is her sister who was too shy to meet him because she is ashamed of her small breasts, so Penny almost tricks Jeremy into giving her money for her \\\"sister's\\\" boob job. However, another guy that Penny swindled finds her in the bar with the cops, and she runs out of there, managing to hide among trash bags since her dress looks like one. Somewhere in France, a Danish man named Mathias (Casper Christensen) spots an American woman, Josephine Chesterfield (Anne Hathaway), sitting alone at a bar. He approaches her and hears her story about winning a lot of chips at the casino. Mathias offers to sell Josephine his mother's valuable bracelet, only for an Interpol officer, Brigitte Desjardins (Ingrid Oliver), to come by and say that Josephine is an international criminal and that she stole the chips from an old man. In reality, Brigitte and the old man, Albert (Nicholas Woodeson), are in cahoots with Josephine, who is really an English woman posing as a dim-witted American to try and con other men. She manages to swipe Mathias's bracelet and swap it with a fake.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"genre\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"horror\",\n          \"action\",\n          \"romance\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 3,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          3,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
