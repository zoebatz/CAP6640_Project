(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) \\n  \\n It's been nearly two months since allegations came to light of a past affair between President Trump and adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, and now Daniels is suing. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) \\n  \\n A top Trump Organization attorney filed a secret legal document to keep Stormy Daniels from talking about her alleged affair with President Trump, deepening links between Trump\\u2019s company and the effort to silence the porn star. \\n  \\n The Trump Organization quickly distanced itself from the document, filed as part of confidential arbitration proceedings in Los Angeles on Feb. 22. The document was made public Wednesday evening by CNN and the Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post confirmed its authenticity with Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for Daniels. \\n  \\n In a statement, the Trump Organization emphasized that the company is not representing anyone in the Daniels dispute and \\u201chas no involvement in the matter.\\u201d \\n  \\n But the document suggests that one of its attorneys was involved in the arbitration proceeding to prevent Daniels from revealing more details about her alleged affair with Trump, which she says began at a 2006 celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. The White House has suggested that Trump prevailed in the recent arbitration ruling. \\n  \\n The document adds a new twist to the saga of Daniels, who claims she was secretly paid to keep quiet about her relationship with Trump just weeks before his election in November 2016. Trump\\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who worked at the Trump Organization through the election, has said he paid $130,000 to Daniels out of his own pocket, dipping into a home equity line of credit. He has said there was no involvement by Trump\\u2019s company or Trump\\u2019s 2016 campaign. \\n  \\n Adult-film star Stormy Daniels reportedly was paid to remain silent about a sexual relationship with Donald Trump before he was president. On March 6, Daniels sued Trump, alleging the hush agreement was invalid because he didn\\u2019t sign it . (The Washington Post) \\n  \\n The Trump company says Jill A. Martin, a lawyer with the Trump Organization, filed the document in her personal capacity while awaiting permission for another lawyer, not connected to the company, to practice in California. That lawyer, Larry Rosen, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday night. \\n  \\n Daniels has sued Trump in an effort to break free from a confidentiality agreement that prohibits her from speaking about her alleged affair with Trump. Her deal came two weeks before the election and imposed stiff monetary penalties for speaking about the relationship. \\n  \\n Cohen, Trump\\u2019s personal lawyer, has acknowledged making that payment. He has insisted that he was not reimbursed for the payment by the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign. \\n  \\n White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has rejected the notion that Trump approved the payment to Daniels, saying, \\u201cNone of these allegations are true.\\u201d \\n  \\n But late last month, after the $130,000 payment became the subject of media scrutiny, Martin signed documents demanding that Daniels enter into private arbitration with Cohen. \\n  \\n Martin is based at the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles, according to California bar records, and her LinkedIn profile says she serves as vice president and assistant general counsel for the Trump Organization. \\n  \\n While the documents do not show that the Trump Organization was involved in the initial payment to Daniels in 2016, they do show that a high-ranking official at the company played a role in efforts to keep the porn star from telling her story now. \\n  \\n Five days after Martin\\u2019s filing, Cohen obtained a temporary restraining order from the arbitrator, preventing Daniels from speaking publicly about the alleged affair. \\n  \\n The notion that Cohen\\u2019s efforts to silence Daniels were walled off from Trump and the Trump Organization \\u201cis a complete and utter fiction,\\u201d Avenatti said Wednesday night on CNN\\u2019s \\u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\\u201d \\n  \\n Cohen \\u201cexpects the American people to believe that he spent all of this time and energy, hours upon hours, doing all of this work, and the president never knew anything about it, and no one in the Trump Organization ever knew anything about it,\\u201d Avenatti said. \\n  \\n Avenatti has said that his goal is to \\u201cshed light\\u201d on Daniels\\u2019s side of the story. He has shown a willingness to surface secret documents, including the original hush agreement Daniels signed in 2016 and that Avenatti contends is invalid because it does not have Trump\\u2019s signature. \\n  \\n Under that hush agreement, disputes must be settled by private arbitration, in which filings are not entered into the public record. The penalty for breaking the agreement is set at $1 million per violation. \\n  \\n Cohen has previously said that Avenatti was exposing Daniels to financial risk and that he intends to pursue damages. \\n  \\n Martin, the Trump Organization lawyer who signed the arbitration documents, is a Trump loyalist who was a vocal supporter of Trump after revelations that he had once bragged about grabbing women. She could not be reached for comment Wednesday. \\n  \\n \\u201cNone of us would ever imagine he would do something like this,\\u201d Martin said on CNN in October 2016. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just completely inconsistent with his character and our own personal experiences, so because of that I believe him when he says he didn\\u2019t do anything inappropriate with women.\\u201d \\n  \\n Also during the presidential campaign, Martin told talk show host Larry King that Trump \\u201cdoes promote women more than I\\u2019ve seen in other big companies,\\u201d describing him as \\u201ca champion of women succeeding in business.\\u201d \\n  \\n Contacted in 2015 for an article about women who had worked closely with Trump, Cohen put forward Martin, who was 35 at the time. Martin, who said she had joined the Trump Organization five years earlier, described Trump as helping to advance her career. When a case went before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, Martin said she expected Trump to ask a more experienced male lawyer to argue for the company. But Trump picked her. \\u201cHe said, \\u2018Jill, you\\u2019ll do great,\\u2019 \\u201d she recalled. \\u201cHe pushed me when I needed it.\\u201d \\n  \\n beth.reinhard@washpost.com \\n  \\n frances.sellers@washpost.com ||||| Stormy Daniels last week filed suit in state court in Los Angeles, seeking to have the nondisclosure agreement tossed out because Donald Trump never signed it. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images BuzzFeed maneuver could free Stormy Daniels to speak on Trump \\n  \\n BuzzFeed may have found a legal opening to allow the porn actress Stormy Daniels to discuss her alleged relationship with President Donald Trump and a $130,000 payment she received just before the 2016 election as part of a nondisclosure agreement she is now trying to void. \\n  \\n The same Trump attorney who brokered the deal with Daniels, Michael Cohen, filed a libel suit in January against BuzzFeed and four of its staffers over publication of the so-called dossier compiling accurate, inaccurate and unproven allegations about Trump\\u2019s relationship with Russia. \\n  \\n Story Continued Below \\n  \\n Now, BuzzFeed is using Cohen\\u2019s libel suit as a vehicle to demand that Daniels preserve all records relating to her relationship with Trump, as well as her dealings with Cohen and the payment he has acknowledged arranging in 2016. \\n  \\n On Tuesday, BuzzFeed\\u2019s lawyer wrote to Daniels\\u2019 attorney asking that the adult film actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, preserve various categories of documents. Such preservation letters are often a prelude to a subpoena. If Daniels\\u2019 testimony is formally demanded in a deposition, the nondisclosure agreement would likely be no obstacle, legal experts said. \\n  \\n The letter from BuzzFeed\\u2019s attorney , obtained by POLITICO, argues that Cohen\\u2019s role in paying Daniels is similar to allegations in the dossier about Cohen. The dossier alleges that Cohen met Russian legal officials and legislators in Prague in August 2016 in a bid to \\u201csweep \\u2026 under the carpet\\u201d details of the relationship between Russia and Trump campaign officials like Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. Cohen has flatly denied the claim. \\n  \\n \\u201cMr. Cohen\\u2019s role in President Trump\\u2019s 2016 campaign, including but not limited to any payments he made or facilitated to third parties during or in connection with the campaign, is therefore directly relevant to\\u201d Cohen\\u2019s suit, BuzzFeed lawyer Katherine Bolger wrote. \\n  \\n The most reliable politics newsletter.

Asked how Daniels would respond, he said, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have a position as of yet.\\u201d He declined further comment. \\n  \\n Last week, Daniels filed suit in state court in Los Angeles, seeking to have the nondisclosure agreement tossed out because Trump never signed it. \\n  \\n The preservation notice sent to Daniels\\u2019 attorney was one of more than a dozen such letters BuzzFeed\\u2019s legal team sent this week to a number of high-profile players in the Trump orbit, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Manafort\\u2019s former deputy Rick Gates, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, former White House adviser Steve Bannon, current White House adviser Kellyanne Conway and former Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller, as well as Trump\\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump\\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. \\n  \\n A deposition by Daniels is probably some months away. It would not typically take place in public, but lawyers for either side would be free to release it or related documents unless a judge forbade it. \\n  \\n Cohen\\u2019s attorney in the libel suit against BuzzFeed, David Schwartz, said on Wednesday he was aware of the preservation letters and would probably object to any attempt by the news outlet to dig into the Daniels episode or other matters not referred to directly in the dossier. \\n  \\n \\u201cCertainly at the appropriate time there\\u2019ll be a fight in court as to limitations in discovery in this case,\\u201d Schwartz told POLITICO. \\u201cWe want a very narrow view of discovery for many different reasons. \\u2026 I think those recipients [of the letters] are going to be irrelevant to the case at hand.\\u201d \\n  \\n Schwartz said he expected to be buried in paperwork from the law firms representing BuzzFeed and Fusion GPS, the private investigation firm that commissioned the dossier. Cohen sued Fusion in a separate, parallel libel case in January. \\n  \\n \\u201cThey\\u2019re going to try to wipe us out with demands on every unrelated issue under the sun,\\u201d the attorney for Cohen said. \\u201cI believe when you know something is fake and you still post it as if it were real, where no other news organization would do such a thing, I think you\\u2019re committing an intentional act and they\\u2019re going to be liable for defamation.\\u201d \\n  \\n A spokesman for BuzzFeed suggested that since the libel suit seeks compensation for damage to Cohen\\u2019s reputation, episodes affecting his public standing are fair game for discovery. \\n  \\n \\u201cMr. Cohen\\u2019s personal reputation, and his actions on Donald Trump\\u2019s behalf, are directly relevant to this case,\\u201d spokesman Matt Mittenthal said. \\u201cWe look forward to defending our First Amendment rights in court.\\u201d \\n  \\n Lorraine Woellert contributed to this report. \\n  \\n  |||||\",\n          \"A document uncovered by Harvard's student newspaper included ratings of the attractiveness of female players as well as sexually explicit comments.\\nUniversity President Drew Faust called the behaviour \\\"appalling\\\".\\nThe team, currently in first place in the Ivy League, will forfeit the rest of its games this season.\\nIn what reports indicate may be a yearly tradition, male soccer players at Harvard circulated documents with pictures of their female counterparts, rating their attractiveness from one to 10 and giving reasons for their decisions.\\nThey also noted which sexual position they thought the women in question would prefer.\\nUntil recently, the Harvard Crimson newspaper reports, documents from 2012 were publicly accessible through a former team's Google Group.\\nMs Faust said an investigation had found that the practice had continued to the current season.\\nShe wrote that she \\\"was deeply distressed to learn that the appalling actions of the 2012 men's soccer team were not isolated to one year or the actions of a few individuals\\\".\\nMs Faust added in a statement: \\\"The decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential, and reflects Harvard's view that both the team's behaviour and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable, have no place at Harvard, and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community.\\\"\\nThe discovery of sexually explicit comments made by male Harvard athletes is at the milder end of what has been dubbed US college \\\"rape culture\\\".\\nBanners regularly appear at the beginning of the academic year bearing slogans such as: \\\"Rowdy and fun.

Britain's former top prosecutor has controversially defended police who hold suspects in a \\u2018legal limbo\\u2019 for years while alleged crimes are investigated. Keir Starmer, the ex- Director of Public Prosecutions, disagreed with those who have called for time limits on how long a person can languish on bail without being charged. He said time \\u2018should not be a barrier\\u2019 to bringing people to justice for crimes committed decades earlier. A number of high-profile celebrities, including Rolf Harris and Stuart Hall, have been convicted of sex crimes that happened years ago after their victims finally plucked up the courage to complain about the attacks. But there have been mounting concerns about cases where suspects are left on bail for long periods \\u2013 often with strict curbs to their freedom \\u2013 without charges being pressed. Veteran disc jockey Paul Gambaccini spent 12 months on bail after being arrested by officers from Operation Yewtree, the inquiry launched after Jimmy Savile was unmasked as a prolific paedophile after his death, only to be told last month (OCT) he would not face sexual assault charges. The openly gay DJ, who was investigated over historic allegations of molesting two teenage boys, told of his \\u201812 months of horror and trauma\\u2019 having his name dragged through the mud. Home Secretary Theresa May has signalled she wants time limits on pre-charge bail amid mounting concern that police forces are misusing their powers by keeping people dangling for months and even years. In an article in this week\\u2019s Radio Times, on sale today TUES, Mr Starmer said the passage of time should not provide immunity against bringing charges against historic offenders. He said: \\u2018I do not underestimate the impact that delay has on those arrested and subsequently released without charge, such as Paul Gambaccini. Equally, there is the impact on those tried and acquitted. \\u2018But they are features of our system whatever the time limits for bringing a case. \\u2018I certainly wouldn\\u2019t want to replicate the situation in countries such as North Korea where virtually all those arrested are charged and virtually all those charged are convicted. \\u2018That some individuals are released without charge and some are acquitted demonstrates the strength, not the weakness, of our approach.\\u2019 Police are allowed 24 hours to keep a suspect for questioning after arrest before seeking a further period of detention from a judge. A number of high-profile celebrities, including Rolf Harris, left, and Stuart Hall, right, have been convicted of sex crimes that happened years ago after their victims finally plucked up the courage to complain . In practice, they often quiz a person then release them on pre-charge bail to return for further interview at a later date, giving officers time to build robust cases. But there are currently no restrictions on the length of time a person can spend on police bail which can force innocent people to put their lives on hold, pay thousands in legal fees and suffer the slow assassination of their character. Conditions can also be placed on police bail, which can include curfews and restrictions on movement and financial transactions while an investigation continues. Comedian Jim Davidson lashed out at the system after being arrested under the Operation Yewtree and kept on bail for eight months before being told he would not face any charges. Freddie Starr, another comedian, spent 19 months on bail after being arrest by officers investigating decades-old sex allegations made by 14 women. The case was dropped. Veteran DJ Paul Gambaccini spent 12 months on bail after being arrested by officers from Operation Yewtree, but was told last month he would not face sexual assault charges . Some 30 journalists are currently on bail \\u2013 some for more than a year \\u2013 while police investigate alleged crimes including phone hacking and paying public officials for stories. The College of Policing, the professional body that sets police standards, have been asked by ministers to consider introducing time limits for pre-charge bail, which human rights groups believe should be 28 days. Mr Starmer said it was right to prosecute people for historic crimes \\u2013 whether it was a \\u2018an Auschwitz guard standing trial in Germany\\u2026 or a host of greying celebrities on suspicion of historic sex crimes.\\u2019 He said there had been a \\u2018profound shift\\u2019 from the long-held view that not bringing a prosecution within a certain period of time was \\u2018not fair on defendents\\u2019. There had been a \\u2018growing understanding that time runs at different speed for victims,\\u2019 particularly those who had suffered sexual violence, he said. \\u2018In a sense they carry an unresolved issue with them, almost an open wound, for many years, maybe even for their entire lives. \\u2018We are rightly reluctant to say that those now coming forward to report serious allegations, not infrequently against those in the public eye, that they are simply too late.\\u2019 Acknowledging that the passage of time caused \\u2018difficiulties\\u2019 for both the prosecution and defence, because of fading memories and lost evidence, he said it was \\u2018simply not a good enough reason not to bring a case\\u2019. Mr Starmer said: \\u2018Most importantly, we now understand victims\\u2019 interests better and recognise that, for many, achieving closure, the knowledge that someone has been held to account, is an end in itself. \\u2018We have to be bolder, and clearer, in saying that pure delay should not be a barrier to bringing people to justice. The public does not accept any longer that the passage of time immunises anyone. \\u2018My own view is that for the most serious offences, and in that I include serious sexual offences, time should never run out.\\u2019\",\n          \"Forget the idea of an old-fashioned ski lodge, the newest Club Med hotel in the French Alps oozes Scandinavian style, chic design and some rather unusual accessories. But with bars and beer taps on each floor, an outdoor Jacuzzi for relaxation and a location just steps from the slopes, it seems this new resort has it all. Val Thorens Sensations is a hotel with a distinctive, quirky design, luxurious touches and even  a climbing wall in the foyer. Scroll down for video . What greets guests when they walk into the reception at Club Med: Val Thorens Sensations . The sleek, Scandinavian-style bedrooms boast gigantic beds and a luxurious seating area . Bedrooms feature a wall mounted television that has access to English channels and a vast library of movies . Every balcony faces the slopes to give guests excellent views and as much sunshine as possible . The new resort is the first of its kind to be completely crowd-sourced. Through Facebook, locals and Club Med fans were invited to vote for what they wanted from the huge 384-room hotel. In response, the look and feel of the resort were tailored based on feedback, from the carpet colours to the new sports facilities. Stepping foot inside the hotel you can't help but be in awe at the scale of the complex. It takes 15 minutes to walk from one block of rooms to another. The bedrooms are all designed so they face the sun, ensuring guests get the most sunshine on offer flooding into the rooms that come complete with a behemoth sized bed and luxurious seating area. One of the many quirky areas in the main dining room is an indoor Yurt . The\\u00a0Epicurious restaurant offers guests a more specialist menu and more luxurious areas they can unwind in . Guests will have access to a spectacular array of wines in the\\u00a0Epicurious restaurant . Staff are trained to give  guests the best advice and recommendations when they are choosing their wine . Epicurious has a balcony with sunbeds and seating areas as well as an outdoor jacuzzi . The hotel has a main restaurant that serves buffet food with a handful of chefs cooking fresh meals to order as well as Epicurious, a separate dining area that offers picnic style food, a wine cellar and even a deli and grocery section. For the boozy members of your party, there is a bar or beer tap on every floor and during the night the fourth floor Prism bar turns into a nightclub, complete with a bizarre-but-must-see French take on Butlins style entertainment. Interestingly, Club Med recently published a report that revealed that families are 'gramping' or going on ski holidays with the grandparents. This new trend also revealed that grandparents are more inclined to pay for the whole holiday as a treat for the family. The view from the\\u00a0Epicurious balcony, showing the hotel's close proximity to the slopes . Val Thorens if the highest resort in France and offers a superb variety of runs for snow sports enthusiasts . MailOnline's Ash Tulett hits the heights of the Val Thorens slopes with his snowboard . Former Olympic skier Graham Bell, an ambassador for the resort, joins writer Ash  to board down the slopes . A week at Club Med's Val Thorens Sensations resort starts from\\u00a0\\u00a31,597 per person, including\\u00a0flights and accommodation, access to all of the hotel's facilities, lift pass, ski instructors and food and drink. Visit clubmed.co.uk . Grandparents were repeatedly cited as an important part of the modern ski holiday with a fifth of holidaymakers having skied with extended family and grandparents in the last two years, probably because they provide excellent free childcare. However, here is where one of the best parts of the Club Med all inclusive concept comes into play. Private ski lessons with the top ESF ski instructors are actually included in your price. What does that mean for you? Well it means that you can either ski as a whole family or split off into three groups without having to worry that anyone is at risk of hurting themselves. Club Med: Val Thorens Sensations boasts a high-tech gym, aerobics studio and steam room . Guests are also given the chance to practice their climbing skills with this indoor climbing wall . To be honest, even if you don't need the lessons, it's worth getting an instructor, just because you can save so much time jumping queues at gondolas and chairlifts. And they're sure to  offer local knowledge and some helpful pointers about technique along the way. One thing you should be aware of is that ski, board and boot rental aren't included in the price and will set you back another \\u00a3150 depending on how much rental gear you need. I preferred to hit the slopes on my snowboard. And after a day of trying (and failing) to beat a five-time Winter Olympian (Graham Bell is a resort ambassador) there was nothing better than heading back to the resort, soaking up the spa and heading for a drink. I can safely say I steered clear of that climbing wall all week.\",\n          \"These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.
